# Design document

## Project requirements
- Is a magazine landing page.
- Has scroll locking backgrounds.
- Has animated background color transitions.
- Has side links that smoothly scroll to each magazine issue.
- Is responsive.

## My goal with this project
1. Refine my CSS hooks
  - Last project I used BEM to create my classes.
  - The CSS depended on the HTML.
Now I want to try using a mix of BEM naming conventions but content agnostic CSS classes. In other words, CSS as a dependency of my HTML.
2. Learn new animation techniques.
3. Explore Javascript scroll events.
